<H3>Personally </H3>
<p>Perhaps the best way of putting it is that I make a hobby out of picking up hobbies. 
I get a lot of enjoyment out of learning new skills and putting them into practice. 
This has manifested in a wide variety of avenues, including things like creative thinking, leadership, voluntary work,
 soft skills, learning web programming, writing and languages. 
 I've been an obsessive reader for quite literally as long as I can remember. Growing up, one of my heroes was Steve Jobs,
 who at the tender age of four had read everything in the children's section and moved on to conquer the rest of the library. 
 One of my greatest disappointments in life is that I will never read all the books. <br>
My site web is : <a href ="http://www.houcima.com/">www.houcima.com</a> , in which I am puting some publications  about the culture and the beauty
 of the city where I born .
